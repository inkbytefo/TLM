# Model Card for Spectral-JAX (Hybrid)

## Model Details

- **Name:** Spectral-JAX Hybrid
- **Version:** 1.0.0-alpha (Phase 1)
- **Developer:** Tevfik İşkın
- **Release Date:** 2025
- **License:** Proprietary (Copyright (c) 2025 Tevfik İşkın. All Rights Reserved.)
- **Model Architecture:** Hybrid Spectral-Attention (Hyena + Sliding Window Attention)
- **Framework:** JAX / Flax

## Model Architecture

Spectral-JAX utilizes a novel **Hybrid Architecture** designed to solve the "Infinite Context vs. Local Precision" trade-off.

1.  **Global Context (Hyena Operators):** 
    - The backbone of the model consists of Hyena blocks (implicit spectral convolutions).
    - These operators provide $O(N \log N)$ scaling, allowing the model to process extremely long sequences (theoretically infinite) without the quadratic cost of standard attention.
    
2.  **Local Precision (Sliding Window Attention):**
    - Interleaved every **6 layers**.
    - A standard Multi-Head Attention layer with a causal sliding window (Window Size: 512).
    - Ensures high-resolution focus on immediate context ("needle-in-a-haystack" retrieval).

3.  **Memory:**
    - **Residual Memory Blocks** allow the model to maintain a persistent state vector across autonomous interaction sessions.

## Intended Use

**Primary Use Case:**
- **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Research:** Investigating the emergence of reasoning and agency in hybrid architectures.
- **Autonomous Agents:** Long-horizon task execution, code generation, and self-improvement.

**Out-of-Scope Use Cases:**
- This model is a research prototype and is not intended for production deployment in safety-critical systems without further safety alignment.

## Training Data & Curriculum

The model follows a strict 3-Phase Curriculum designed to mimic human cognitive development.

### Phase 1: Morphological Foundation (Logic)
*   **Status:** In Progress
*   **Goal:** Learn strict compositional logic and syntax.
*   **Data Composition:**
    - 80% High-Quality Turkish (Academic/Literature) - *Agglutinative morphology as a proxy for logic.*
    - 20% Code (GitHub) - *Formal logic and algorithmic structure.*

### Phase 2: World Knowledge (Expansion)
*   **Status:** Planned
*   **Goal:** Absorb a comprehensive world model.
*   **Data Composition:**
    - 40% English (The Pile)
    - 30% Turkish (General Web)
    - 30% Code

### Phase 3: Recursive Self-Improvement (Agency)
*   **Status:** Planned
*   **Goal:** Autonomous reasoning and self-correction.
*   **Data Source:** Synthetic data generated by the model itself (`self_improve.py`), filtered for correctness ("Golden Data").

## Performance (Phase 1 Estimates)

*Note: These are preliminary results from the ongoing Phase 1 training.*

| Metric | Value | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Training Loss** | ~1.5 (Target) | Converging steadily. |
| **Context Length** | 1024 (Train) / Infinite (Inference) | Hyena operators allow extrapolation beyond training length. |
| **Extrapolation** | 2x, 4x Success | Validated via `eval_extrapolation` hook. |
| **Inference Speed** | High | Due to sub-quadratic Hyena complexity. |

## Ethical Considerations

- **Bias:** The model is trained on web data and may reflect inherent biases found in the training corpus.
- **Safety:** As an autonomous agent capable of executing code, the model runs in a sandboxed environment (`src/tools/executor.py`) to prevent harmful actions.
- **Alignment:** Phase 3 training will focus on aligning the model's autonomous goals with human intent.
